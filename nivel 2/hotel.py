# 4. The RH Hotels chain has hired you to design the booking algorithm for their mobile application:

# Login; it should be locked after the third failed attempt.
# The RH Hotels chain exists in 5 countries: Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, and Germany.
# Each country has its own hotels located in: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Munich, Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Marseille, Madeira, Lisbon, and Porto.
# All hotels have 24 rooms each: 6 VIP suites, 3 single rooms, 6 double rooms, 6 group rooms, and 3 luxury suites.
# The user can make reservations at any time of the year and at any hour, and book as many rooms as desired.
# Single rooms are priced at $100 per night, double rooms at $200 per night, group rooms at $350 per night, VIP suites at $450 per night, and luxury suites at $550 per night, applicable at any time of the year.
# The algorithm functions as follows: Login, choose country, choose city, choose room type, select the number of nights, collect user data (name, surname, ID/passport), 
# print the total cost, and if the user agrees, print a confirmation message for the reservation. If not, return to the main menu.
