# 4. Old Trafford Stadium

# The executive management of Manchester United FC aims to implement a ticket sales system for the team's matches at Old Trafford Stadium. Develop a ticket purchase system with the following features:

# Membership Discount:
# Users with a Manchester United membership card receive a 15% discount on their total purchase.
# Seating Capacity and Distribution:
# The total seating capacity at Old Trafford is 74,310.
# 5% for VIP boxes, 15% for VIP seats, and 80% for general seating.
# Seat Selection:
# Seats are identified by a ticket number from 1 to 74,310.
# Users can choose their seats.
# The first seats correspond to VIP boxes, the next to the VIP area, and the rest to general seating (considering the percentages).
# Ticket Purchase Limits:
# Users with a membership card can buy up to 10 tickets, while non-members can purchase up to 3 tickets.
# Seat Availability Validation:
# The system must validate if a seat has already been sold to another user and offer a nearby seat if necessary.
# Seat Costs:
# VIP boxes: £1000 per seat.
# VIP seats: £500 per seat.
# General seating: £90 per seat.
# System Workflow:
# Login.
# Confirm membership status.
# Select seats.
# Make payment.
# Generate and issue tickets.
# Remaining Seat Display:
# The system should display the number of available seats after each purchase.
